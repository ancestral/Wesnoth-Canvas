# Wesnoth Canvas
A web site for displaying game maps for *The Battle for Wesnoth.*

Canvas has been overhauled. Consider this Version 2.

## What is Wesnoth Bestiary?
This is a web site for display maps for displaying game maps for a free strategy game called *The Battle For Wesnoth.* (Not familiar? Check it out at http://www.wesnoth.org) Part of it is an experiment and self-learning to the wonderful ways of JavaScript, jquery, and web design. As I continue to work on the project, it will eventually be a place to create, edit and save maps — and perhaps more.

## Why here?
Why not? I need a place that’s publicly accessible online so I can make edits from various different machines. I also want to make it relatively easy for people to download the files so they can test and debug it themselves. It is mirrored at http://mproud.com/wesnoth/canvas for your convenience.

## Where can I learn more?
Visit the Wesnoth forums, at:

## Changelog
Version 2 Build 1
5 July 2012
* Moved out tBfW dependencies. You’ll need to download the game resources and place them on the server.
* Changed index.html to index.php, partially for dynamic data directory support.
* Altered canvases to include a viewport, and changes as the window resizes. This should hopefully help with performance.
* Fixed various bugs.

Versioin 1 Build 1
26 April
* First entire upload of the project.
